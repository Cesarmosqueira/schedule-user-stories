## 1. Description of the problem to solve
Nowadays, the Agile methodology is one of the most used by several companies in different sectors.  
The main advantages of Agile are:  
**1. Improves quality:** Minimizes errors in deliverables and improves customer experience and functionality.  
**2. Increased engagement:** Improves employee satisfaction and generates team awareness.  
**3. Speed:** Shorten production cycles and minimize reaction and decision making times.  
**4. Increased productivity:** By allocating resources better and more dynamically, production improves according to the company's priorities.  

#### User Story Definition  
  
To define _User Story Mapping_ in English, we must first start from the notion of the _user story_. This refers to the user's narrative or expectations of the product and the clear representation of them, based on information such as:  
  
- Identification 
- prioritization
- estimation of the volume of work required 
- demonstration
- complementary observations
  
#### _User Story Mapping_: objective  
  
In this sense and in order to carry out this representation, we speak of _story mapping_ or user story mapping. From this, the expertise of the Product Owner and the information he has collected from his customers, is organized and presented in a clearer way. For example:  

"As a [type of user], I would like to have [this functionality] with which I can benefit [in this way]."

There are times when you have a lot of user stories that need to be done in a period of time. You also have a limited amount of developers who can do the task and many have priority other the other ones (for example time).

The Scrum Muster (or Product Owner) may assign the tasks in the order they believe is the best (according to the client or de General Manager) but it is not necesarly the best way and the most efficient way posible to do it


## 2. Motivation to solve the problem  
We are just about to finish college and already having experience doing various jobs with my colleagues (university jobs and with clients), to organize the execution of these projects, plan strategies and, above all, see the tasks we have to do and see their priorities is a complicated task when the client wants to see progress over the weeks. 

Having a tool that allows us to see which is the best way to organize the user stories in an efficient way, would help us to be able to organize ourselves more clearly throughout the project and finish the deadlines before the date or at least on time.  Also, to explain the client how are we going to setup the priorities so he can clearly understand the prosses and view all the project in the big picture.
